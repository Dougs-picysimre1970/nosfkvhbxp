Just walked out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Dual... and wow, let’s just say I’m not sure if I'm inspired or just straight-up confused. Like, imagine if a mirror had some deep emotional crisis and started showing you your morning face all day long. To say Dual was a trip would be the understatement of the century.

I mean, do we really need to question the whole “what makes me, me?” thing on a Tuesday night? With my brain already fried from a day of emails, I’m not sure if this was enlightening or just brain fog with really nice cinematography. The characters were... let's call them “interesting” (is that what cool people say when they don't really know what to say?). But seriously, there were moments where empathy hit me like a truck—just suddenly overwhelmed with “oh, yep, been there.” And then, just as quickly, my mind would wander to why the theater still smells like popcorn even though I know they have nachos now. Priorities, right?

>You’ve got these scenes that make you think someone was pulling a random thoughts vending machine and hoping whatever spewed out would stick. Maybe there's, like, some hidden profundity under all that, but at points, I wondered why I didn't just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it with popcorn and slipper socks on, you know? But ugh, then again, maybe that would’ve taken away some of the charm — or maybe the irritation. Who knows?

```csharp
if(identity == questionable)
{
    identity.CreateClone();
    happiness = false;
}
```

But, at the end of the day, I can’t deny it gripped me. Even if I can't pinpoint whether it's out of genuine interest or the kind of morbid curiosity you get when you smell something weird in the fridge. Oh well. Pondering whether or not I'm secretly a clone can wait until tomorrow.
